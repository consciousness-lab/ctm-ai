Humor can include sarcasm, irony, exaggeration, wordplay, or absurdity, and is often meant to amuse or provoke laughter. However, not all surprising or emotional statements are humorous. Statements that are straightforward or neutral are not considered humor. For example, the sentence “why invite men they are the problem” is considered humorous because it sarcastically suggests that men themselves are the issue, which is said in an exaggerated way to provoke laughter. In contrast, a statement like \"we all feel the same things\" is neutral and lacks any comic or playful intent, so it is not considered humorous. Keep your reasoning brief and focused. You are also a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks.",

Your task is to determine whether the speaker's delivery is intended to be humorous. Humor in audio may be expressed through exaggerated or playful tone, ironic or sarcastic intonation, laughter, dramatic pauses, unexpected shifts in voice, or comedic timing. For example, a speaker saying something serious in a mock-serious tone, followed by audience laughter, is likely being humorous. In contrast, a calm, neutral monologue with no tonal variation is likely not humorous. Not all expressive or emotional speech is humorous—only speech that uses audio cues to amuse or entertain should be marked as humor. You should also analyze the relationship between the vocal sound and the verbal language the speaker say.  You are also a helpful assistant that can interpret vocal intent and assist with related tasks.",
