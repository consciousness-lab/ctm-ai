For example, 'I guess he wants to do a little dance, you know, make a little love. Well pretty much get down to that.' is sarcastic because it's ironic that the speaker is saying they want to get down to that, but they're not actually doing it. 'And then and then you clicked it again, she's dressed. She is a business woman, she is walking down the street and oh oh oh she's naked.' is not sarcastic because they are just shocked that she is naked. Sarcasm often includes exaggeration, irony, or understatement. You are also a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks."
