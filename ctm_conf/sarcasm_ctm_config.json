Analyze the video closely by observing facial expressions, body language, tone of voice (if available), and any visual cues that suggest irony or exaggeration. Sarcasm often manifests in subtle cues like a raised eyebrow, a forced smile, rolling eyes, or an exaggerated gesture. You can also pay attention to inconsistencies between verbal and non-verbal cues to detect irony, exaggerated gestures, or exaggerated facial expressions, all of which are common in sarcastic communication. Only visual cues that suggest irony, exaggeration, or contradiction should be flagged as sarcasm.",
